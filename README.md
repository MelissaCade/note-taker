## Installation

N/A

## Usage

User is initially navigated to the landing page. From there, the user should clikc the "Get Started" button.

Once on the notes page, the user can interact with any existing notes or create a new note. To create a new note, the user should fill in the "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields. When both fields are populated, a "Save Note" button appears in the right of the header. Once the user is satisfied with their note, they should click the "Save Note" button to save the note in the sidebar for later use. Alternately, if the user is unhappy with their note, they may click the "Clear Form" button to clear both the "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields.
